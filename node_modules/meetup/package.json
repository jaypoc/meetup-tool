  "readme": "# Meetup js\n\nA node.js interface for the [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) api based roughly on [node-twitter](https://github.com/jdub/node-twitter)\n\n## usage\n\nThis library supports both stream and low-level REST client interfaces.\n\nThe `stream` interface takes a path of the streamed resource you wish to consume and a function callback which will be provided a stream object. You can register a listener on one of the following event names.\n\n* data - emits an single item from the stream\n* error - emits an error throwing in processing of stream\n\nBelow is an example set up\n\n    var Meetup = require(\"meetup\")\n    var mup = new Meetup()\n    mup.stream(\"/2/rsvps\", function(stream){\n      stream\n        .on(\"data\", function(item){\n          console.log(\"got item \" + item)\n        }).on(\"error\", function(e) {\n           console.log(\"error! \" + e)\n        });\n    });    \n\nThe `REST` interface supports a `get` and `post` interface. \nThese REST interfaces require authentication with Meetup before they can be used.\n\n     var Meetup = require(\"meetup\")\n     var mup = new Meetup({\n       clientId:\"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\"\n       , clientSecret:\"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\"\n       , redirectUri:\"YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\"\n       })\n\nOnce configured, you can redirect the user-agent to the url returned by `mup.getAuthorizeUrl()`. Once the user authorizes your client their user-agent will be redirected back to YOUR_REDIRECT_URI with a `code` needed to obtain an access token.\n\n    mup.getAccessToken(code, function(err, access, refresh, others) {\n        if (err) {\n           // do something about it\n        } else {\n           // at this point mup is automatically configured with the access token\n           // you are free to start making requests here\n        }\n    })\n    \nOnce you have an access token you can make requests in the form.\n\n    mup.get(\"/2/member/self\", function(err, data){\n      console.log(\"got data \" + data)\n    })\n",
